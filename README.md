The dataset all_sales.csv tracks the sales (as of December 2016) of over 16000 video games.

I got this dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/sidtwr/videogames-sales-datasetand cleaned it up a bit using LibreOffice (Linux Ubuntu's version of Excel).

I then ran some SQL queries to answer some questions I had about the dataset.

Feel free to go through the queries.sql file and try it out for yourself.
Enjoy!
